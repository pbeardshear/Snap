Snap
=========

Snap is a simple library that adds more snap locations to windows.

Starting in Windows 7, `Win`+`↑`, `Win`+`↓`, `Win`+`←`, `Win`+`→` shortcuts would maximize, minimize, and "snap" the current window to the half left and half right of the screen.  

Snap adds four additional snap locations, in the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right quarters of the screen.

To use snap, hold `Win+Ctrl` and use the arrow keys to move the current screen to different snap locations.
